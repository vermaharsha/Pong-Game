# 🎮 Pong Game - JavaScript Canvas Edition

A classic Pong game recreation built using **HTML5 Canvas** and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The player controls the left paddle with mouse movement, while the right paddle is controlled by a basic AI. This project demonstrates game physics, paddle-ball collision logic, and responsive animation via `requestAnimationFrame`.

## 🧩 1. Project Overview

This is a browser-based version of the iconic Pong game. It utilizes core JavaScript functionalities to create an interactive, real-time paddle-and-ball game with a simple AI opponent. This game runs entirely in the browser with no external game engine or library dependencies.

## ✨ 2. Features

* **Mouse-controlled Paddle:** Move the left paddle using your mouse.
* **AI Paddle:** Right paddle follows the ball with basic logic.
* **Ball Bounce Physics:** Reflects off paddles and walls with angle-based direction.
* **Scoring Logic:** Ball resets after missing either paddle (point scored).
* **Collision Spin Effect:** Collision point adds variation to ball’s bounce angle.
* **Center Net:** Aesthetic dotted net in the center of the game.
* **Smooth Gameplay:** Uses `requestAnimationFrame()` for efficient rendering.
